Reflection on Django Project Setup

Setting up my Django environment for this project came with several challenges. Initially, I struggled with managing the virtual environment, as I was unsure whether the venv was correctly activated in PowerShell. After researching and following the correct activation command, I confirmed that the virtual environment was active, allowing me to install Django and other dependencies without errors. Another challenge was connecting the project to GitHub. I encountered issues when trying to add and commit files because the README.md did not exist, causing Git to throw an error. I resolved this by either creating a README file or directly adding all project files with `git add .`. Running the Django development server also presented minor issues with port usage and module paths. By carefully checking the terminal messages and ensuring all dependencies were installed, I successfully launched the server with `python manage.py runserver`. Overall, these challenges taught me the importance of carefully managing environments, understanding Git workflows, and reading error messages carefully. Overcoming these obstacles made me more confident in setting up and maintaining Django projects in the future.
